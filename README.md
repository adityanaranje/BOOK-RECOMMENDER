# Project Title : BOOK RECOMMENDATION USING COLLABORATIVE FILTERING
# Technologies : Machine Learning Technology
# Domain : Recommendation System


## What actually is Recommendation System?
### A recommendation engine is a class of machine learning which offers relevant suggestions to the customer.  Before the recommendation system, the major tendency to buy was to take a suggestion from friends. But Now Google knows what news you will read, Youtube knows what type of videos you will watch based on your search history, watch history, or purchase history. A recommendation system helps an organization to create loyal customers and build trust by them desired products and services for which they came on your site. The recommendation system today are so powerful that they can handle the new customer too who has visited the site for the first time. They recommend the products which are currently trending or highly rated and they can also recommend the products which bring maximum profit to the company. For this particular project we have used collabrotive filtering.

## What is collaborative filtering?

### Collaborative based filtering recommender systems are based on past interactions of users and target items.  In simple words here, we try to search for the look-alike customers and offer products based on what his or her lookalike has chosen. Let us understand with an example. X and Y are two similar users and X user has watched A, B, and C movie. And Y user has watched B, C, and D movie then we will recommend A movie to Y user and D movie to X user. Youtube has shifted its recommendation system from content-based to Collaborative based filtering technique. If you have experienced sometimes there are also videos which not at all related to your history but then also it recommends it because the other person similar to you has watched it. :- Analytics Vidhya




## Problem Statement:
### -> Just like Netflix many other apps are all about connecting people to the movies they love. For that it is must to provide user's what they need. So for that it necessary to know what the user need and that can be possible using recommendation systems. This gives a better user experience.

## Aim/Goal :
## To create an end to end api for book recommendation system using the collaborative filtering.

## Approach
### -> The classical machine learning tasks like Data collection, Data Cleaning, Feature Selection, Feature Engineering, Model Deployment. Created the vectores for each movie which will be used for recommendation of movie for corresponding selected movie.

## Dataset
### The dataset is taken from kaggle.
### Link :- https://www.kaggle.com/rxsraghavagrawal/book-recommender-system
### It consists of three csv files -
#### 1. Books – first are about books which contain all the information related to books like an author, title, publication year, etc.
#### 2. Users – The second file contains registered user’s information like user id, location.
#### 3. ratings –  Ratings contain information like which user has given how much rating to which book.
### So based on all these three files we can build a powerful collaborative filtering model. let’s get started.





## Tools Used:
### 1. Python 
### 2. Pandas
### 3. Numpy
### 4. Sklearn
### 5. Flask
